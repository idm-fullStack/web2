        "It is useless to try to apply the “Parrondo paradox” to roulette in a casino, since switching B1-B2 through the capital multiplicity assumes an equal odd amount of winning/loss (+/-1) at different odds, but in roulette (unlike coins) everything is the other way around - odds are linearly tied to the size of the win/loss (which is the basis of the balance of chances and the impartiality of randomness).
